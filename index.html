    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I'm deeply curious about how new technologies challenge established power structures and make new forms of organization possible. I focus on technical literacy as a core skill set and will help you understand your digital environment in order to make better decisions about your safety and effectiveness.</p>
    <p>Please get in touch if you need my help sharpening the edges of your project for impact in the form of concrete, positive outcomes, or if you have information relevant to my investigations. You can also hire me for speaking engagements or commission pieces of writing.</p>
